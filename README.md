This repository holds materials for a 90-minute workshop on building and utilizing effective colormaps for climate science visualizations. The workshop begins with a 15-minute presentation on colormap basics (e.g., different types of colormaps with examples and best practices for usage), followed by a 15-minute presentation on the more quantitative aspects of evaluating colormaps, and then a 60-minute period (including presentations) where participants use online tools to build their own colormaps.
