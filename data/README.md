# Observational Data

Most observations were pulled from the already post-processed `MPAS-Analysis` set: https://mpas-analysis.readthedocs.io/en/master/observations.html. We try to provide a simple 1degree product for a single time slice (e.g., climatology over some period). The goal here is to showcase student-designed colormaps.
